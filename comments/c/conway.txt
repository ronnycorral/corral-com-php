<CENTER><H2>My Brush with Deborah</H2></CENTER>
<P>I was first introduced to <A HREF="http://www.deborahconway.com/"> Deborah Conway</A>'s music while I was on an extended business trip to Melbourne.  There was a poster in the window of the Virgin Megastore announcing an instore appearance by Deborah where she was going to record a show for <EM>Live at the Wireless</EM>.  I had never heard of her before but the poster, which was an enlargement of the <EM>Bitch Epic</EM> cover, was very eye catching.  I looked at the CD and saw the song title 'Madame Butterfly is in Trouble' and thought anybody who could come up with a title like that was worth checking out.

<P>The day of the show I went to the store and wondered around trying to figure out where she would be playing when I heard some very loud singing coming from the back room followed by a womans voice saying "OK, I think the mikes are working now".  Figuring that must be the place I hung out there until the show started which turned out to be excellent.  She did several songs from <EM>Bitch Epic</EM> and one from <EM>String of Pearls</EM>.  

<P>I was having a great time except for the fact that some guy kept cutting in front of me, blocking my view.  He would hang out for half a song then wonder off, then come back again.  After about the third time I stepped forward and took the space he kept moving in to.  He came back, crowded in and put his arm around a woman who was also standing there.  I made the mistake of glancing over in his direction.  As soon as he saw I had acknowledged him he said "Hey man, I'm trying to watch the show with my woman.  You got a problem with that?" and I said "when you keep coming and going, blocking my view yes I do".  He said "I've only left once and that was to go to the toilet.  What's it to you anyway?".  I just said "Apparently nothing" and turned back to the show where it looked like Deborah was looking in our direction.  I could see from the corner of my eye the guy kept looking in my direction for a while then stomped off, never to be seen by me again.

<P>After the show Deborah was signing CDs.  I decided to pick one up and stood in line for her to sign it.  When I got to her she said "Hi" and asked what my name was.  I said "Ron" and she asked if that was spelled "R Y A N".  It was <EM>very</EM> common in Australia for people to think I said Ryan instead of Ron for my name.  I said "No, it's R O N" when she floored me by saying "Oh, you're an American, well that explains it" and <A HREF="/images/covers/c/cdbitlg.jpg">signed the CD</A>.  To this day I still wonder if being an American explained her misunderstanding my name or almost getting into a fight during her show.  She handed back the CD and asked if I had listened to it yet.  I didn't think it would be too cool to say I'd never even heard of her until a couple of days ago, so I said I hadn't had a chance yet.  She said "Well you should go straight home and listen to it.  It's really good.  Make sure you listen to it".  I said I would and left the store laughing.
