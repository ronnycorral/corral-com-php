<p>I got both of these CDs when I saw The Balanescu Quartet play at the Tower Records in central London on March 21st, 1994.  I didn't get a chance to have the CDs signed since it was much more important that I see <A HREF="/cdcoll.php?artist_id=143">Bruce Gilbert</A> of <A HREF="/cdcoll.php?artist_id=366">Wire</A> fame and by the time he was done they were gone.  This is an interesting group, a string quartet that plays songs by David Byrne and Kraftwork.</p>
