      <p>This web site is over 20 years old. The only old content that's still around is the CD Collection page which started out as Perl scripts parsing text files. Version 2.0 was still straight HTML but the Perl CGI's were replaced with PHP. This is version 2.5. With the addition of CSS and Javascript, hopefully this looks like it was written fairly recently instead of last century. Version 3.0 will be some sort of moden framework, once I decide what I feel like learning.</p>

      <p>Version 1.0 was HTML and the CD Collection page was a Perl CGI that parsed through text files that were exported from an Excel spreadsheet that contained the CD and artist info. After a few months a webcam was installed which I dubbed the RonCam.</p>
